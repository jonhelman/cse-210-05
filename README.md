## Description
This game is based on the Light Cycles game from the 1982 movie, "TRON". The game is a two-player versus game. Players must assume one of the two dueling light cycles, cruising around the map until one hits the others trail. However if both cycles crashes into each other, then there will be no winner.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
python3 -m pip install raylib

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 cycle
```

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio Code and start the game by running the "__main.py__" program. (Make sure you are using a python version that has Raylib installed or else it will not work)

## Requirements

* Python 3.8.0 or any version above.
* Raylib Python CFFI 3.7
